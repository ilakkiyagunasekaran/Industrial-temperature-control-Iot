PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem statement for industrial temperature control is that many industrial processes require precise and consistent temperature control, but achieving and maintaining this control can be challenging. Factors such as variations in ambient temperature, equipment malfunction, and human error can all affect temperature control and lead to issues such as decreased efficiency, reduced product quality, increased maintenance costs, and safety hazards.
Therefore, the problem statement for industrial temperature control is how to design, implement, and maintain effective temperature control systems that can meet the uniquetemperature requirements of different industrial processes, respond quickly to temperature changes, and minimize the impact of external factors on temperature control.
 INTRODUCTION:
          Industrial temperature control refers to the management and regulation of temperature within various industrial processes and environments. It involves the use of specialized equipment, technologies, and systems to maintain optimal temperature conditions for efficient operation, product quality, and worker safety. In industrial settings, temperature control is crucial across a wide range of applications, including manufacturing, chemical processing, food and beverage production, pharmaceuticals, energy generation, and many others. Proper temperature control ensures that industrial processes function smoothly and reliably, preventing equipment malfunctions, product defects, and safety hazards. Industrial temperature control systems typically consist of several components, including temperature sensors, controllers, actuators, and heat transfer mechanisms. These systems are designed to monitor and adjust temperatures within specific parameters, ensuring that they remain within the desired range. And we have used DHT11 for temperature and humidity sensor.
          Efficient temperature control also has significant implications for energy consumption and environmental impact. By employing advanced control strategies and energy-efficient technologies, industrial facilities can reduce energy waste, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, and lower operational costs.
           Industrial temperature control plays a vital role in several industries, including manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, petrochemicals, automotive, and many others. In manufacturing processes, precise temperature control is essential for achieving desired material properties.
OBJECTIVES:
To maintaining safe temperature ranges, temperature control systems can help to prevent accidents and injuries.
 It can help to optimize the efficiency of industrial processes and reduce energy waste.
